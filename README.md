## Abstract

This study presents 14 years of rotavirus A surveillance conducted by the National Reference Center for Rotaviruses in Belgium from 2009 to 2023. We analyzed 8,024 rotavirus-positive stool samples collected throughout Belgium, with G and/or P genotypes determined for 6,352 samples through sequencing of genes encoding outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4.

The study reveals unusual dominance of equine-like G3P[8] genotype with DS-1-like genotype constellation after the COVID-19 pandemic, providing crucial insights into rotavirus epidemiology changes during and post-pandemic periods.

## Key Findings

- Analysis of 8,024 rotavirus-positive samples over 14 years
- Significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on rotavirus surveillance numbers
- Unusual dominance of equine-like G3P[8] genotype post-pandemic
- DS-1-like genotype constellation characteristics
- Temporal and demographic analysis of rotavirus genotypes in Belgium
